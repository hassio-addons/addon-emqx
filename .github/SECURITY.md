## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, report them privately through GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting:

[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/hassio-addons/app-emqx/security/advisories/new)

If for any reason you are unable to use GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting, you may also reach out to the maintainer by email at
[opensource@frenck.dev](mailto:opensource@frenck.dev).

When reporting, please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept.
- Affected version(s) of the app.
- Any known mitigations or workarounds.

## Disclosure Timeline

- **Acknowledgement:** you will receive an acknowledgement of your report
  within **48 hours**.
- **Initial assessment:** a triage and initial severity assessment will be
  shared within **7 days** of the acknowledgement.
- **Fix and disclosure:** valid reports are targeted for resolution and
  coordinated public disclosure within **90 days** of the initial report,
  depending on complexity and impact.

You will be kept informed throughout the process and credited in the release
notes for the fix, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities in this project:

- Vulnerabilities in upstream or transitive dependencies. These are handled
  continuously by [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and
  addressed through regular dependency updates.
- Issues in EMQX itself; please report those directly to the
  [EMQX project](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/security/policy).
- Issues in the Home Assistant Supervisor or Operating System; please report
  those directly to the
  [Home Assistant project](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/policy).
- Exposure of the app to untrusted networks as a result of the user's own
  configuration, such as reaching the MQTT listeners or the dashboard from
  outside the local network, or leaving the default dashboard credentials in
  place.

## Scope

This security policy covers the EMQX Home Assistant app published from this
repository, including its container images and configuration.
