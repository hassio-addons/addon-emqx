# Home Assistant Community Add-on: EMQX

[EMQX][emqx] is an Open-source MQTT broker with a high-performance real-time
message processing engine, powering event streaming for IoT devices at massive
scale. As the most scalable MQTT broker, EMQX can help you connect any device,
at any scale (including your home).

The [EMQX MQTT broker][emqx] is an advanced alternative to the Mosquitto MQTT
broker/add-on that is generally used in Home Assistant. It has a UI
to configure, manage, and debug your MQTT broker, clients, and traffic.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

   [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Start the "EMQX" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "EMQX" to see if everything went well.
1. Open the Web UI.
1. Log in with the default credentials:
   username `admin` and password `public`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
env_vars:
  - name: EMQX_NODE__NAME
    value: "something@else.local"
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `env_vars`

This option allows you to tweak every aspect of EMQX by setting
configuration options using environment variables. See the example at the
start of this chapter to get an idea of how the configuration looks.

For more information about using these variables, see the official EMQX
documentation:

<https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v5.0/admin/cfg.html>

**Note**: _Only environment variables starting with `EMQX_` are accepted.\_

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on cannot run simultaneously with the Mosquitto add-on.
